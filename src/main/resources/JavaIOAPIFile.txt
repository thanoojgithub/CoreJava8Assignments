ExecutorService is a complete solution for asynchronous processing. It manages an in-memory queue and schedules submitted tasks based on thread availability.
To use ExecutorService, we need to create one Runnable class.

User threads are high-priority threads. The JVM will wait for any user thread to complete its task before terminating it.
On the other hand, daemon threads are low-priority threads whose only role is to provide services to user threads.
Since daemon threads are meant to serve user threads and are only needed while user threads are running, they won't prevent the JVM from exiting once all user threads have finished their execution.
That's why infinite loops, which typically exist in daemon threads, will not cause problems, because any code, including the finally blocks, won't be executed once all user threads have finished their execution. For this reason, daemon threads are not recommended for I/O tasks.
However, there're exceptions to this rule. Poorly designed code in daemon threads can prevent the JVM from exiting. For example, calling Thread.join() on a running daemon thread can block the shutdown of the application.

Any thread inherits the daemon status of the thread that created it. Since the main thread is a user thread, any thread that is created inside the main method is by default a user thread.
The method setDaemon() can only be called after the Thread object has been created and the thread has not been started. An attempt to call setDaemon() while a thread is running will throw an IllegalThreadStateException:
